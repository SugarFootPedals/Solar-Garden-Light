This is a good replacement for those small "Solar Garden Lights"
with the Solar Cells that measure 2 1/8 X 2 1/4 inches (approx. 2volts). ((some are small and circular)).

They normally have a 4-pin proprietary Chinese Part that is hard source,except from China ( IC #YX8018).

The circuit boards in these cheap lights have no solder-mask and
will corrode.

Of course, it would be easier and cheaper to just replace the 
whole damn thing, but I like to build things!
Plus, now you can now build a solar light altogether!

This circuit (like the original) can ONLY USE the small solar-cells
and a RECHARGABLE battery NO LARGER than 1.2 Volts !!!

It will not work with a 3.7v LiPo (I tried).

Verified working, provided you follow my advice - Only Use the
small solar-cells (2 Volt) and 1.2 Volt Rechargeable AAA Battery.
(I have several in my yard and all are working better than the
original).

I recommend a Schottky diode for D1, but any general purpose
diode will do.

The best part is, I found a small Transformer that you can use
instead of having to wind one.
It is a Center-tap and fits right into the Circuit Board.
(The secondary of the transformer is NOT used).

All resistors are 1/8 Watt.
Transistors are common NPN 2N3904.
The Transformer is from DigiKey #811-3736-ND
Manufacturer number is #78615/3C by Pulse. (200uH)

The LED can be soldered to the circuit board, or mounted off board.

The 220K resistor (marked with ***) can be adjusted slightly, if
the light fails to turn on at dusk or comes on too soon.
I found this value works fine for me !
